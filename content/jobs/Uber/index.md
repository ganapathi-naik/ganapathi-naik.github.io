- I am part of Uber’s Engineering Metric Dashboard team. Effectively measuring and improving engineering productivity involves continuously gathering insights into what makes software engineers more productive and helps us make data driven actions to resolve the identified issues. Our team’s mission is to boost developer productivity by improving processes, and introduce new tools to raise awareness of problems that we as an engineering org can solve together.
